# 🧠 Deep Learning PyTorch Basics

Welcome to **deep-learning-pytorch-basics**. This repository contains a progressive collection of scripts designed to master the fundamentals of Deep Learning using **PyTorch**.

The project documents the journey from basic tensor manipulation to building, training, and saving a functional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into two main directories: `scripts` for the source code and `models` for the trained artifacts.
